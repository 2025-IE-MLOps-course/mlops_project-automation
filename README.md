# MLOps Pipeline for Opioid Abuse Disorder Prediction

This repository provides a modular, **production-quality** MLOps pipeline for binary classification of opioid abuse disorder, built as part of an academic project in the fundamentals of MLOps. The codebase is designed to bridge the gap between research prototypes (Jupyter notebooks) and scalable, maintainable machine learning systems in production.

## 🚦 Project Status

**Phase 1: Modularization, Testing, and Best Practices**
- Jupyter notebook translated into well-documented, test-driven Python modules
- End-to-end pipeline: data ingestion, validation, feature engineering, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and batch inference
- Robust configuration via `config.yaml` and reproducibility through explicit artifact management
- Extensive unit testing with pytest
- Strict adherence to software engineering and MLOps best practices

**Planned Phase 2: Automation and Full MLOps Integration**
- Experiment tracking with MLflow and/or Weights & Biases (W&B)
- Automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions
- Dynamic configuration with Hydra
- End-to-end workflow orchestration

## 🔬 Problem Description

The pipeline predicts **opioid abuse disorder** based on anonymized claims data, engineered features, and diagnostic group flags. It applies rigorous validation and modular design suitable for research, teaching, and real-world deployment.

## 🛠️ Pipeline Modules

### 1. Data Loading (`src/data_load/data_loader.py`)
- Loads data from CSV/Excel as specified in `config.yaml`
- Loads secrets from `.env` (for secure environments)
- Robust error handling and logging

### 2. Data Validation (`src/data_validation/data_validator.py`)
- Validates schema, column types, ranges, missing values
- Configurable strictness: `raise` or `warn` on errors
- Outputs detailed validation reports (JSON)

### 3. Feature Engineering (`src/features/feature_eng.py`)
- Implements scikit-learn compatible transformers (e.g., clinical risk score)
- Easily extendable for future feature construction

### 4. Preprocessing Pipeline (`src/preprocess/preprocessing.py`)
- Modular scikit-learn pipelines
- Prevents data leakage: pipeline fit **only on train split**

### 5. Model Training and Evaluation (`src/model/model.py`)
- Data split (train/valid/test) with stratification
- Model registry (easily swap DecisionTree, LogisticRegression, RandomForest)
- Evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1, ROC AUC, etc.
- Metrics, models, and pipeline saved as artifacts

### 6. Batch Inference (`src/inference/inferencer.py`)
- Loads preprocessing and model artifacts
- Transforms new data, predicts outcomes, exports CSV

### 7. Unit Testing (`tests/`)
- Full pytest suite for each module
- Sample/mock data provided for CI/CD

## ⚙️ Configuration and Reproducibility

- **config.yaml**: All settings for data, model, features, metrics, and paths
- **environment.yml**: Reproducible Conda environment (Python, scikit-learn, pandas, PyYAML, etc.)
- **Artifacts**: All intermediate and final artifacts (preprocessing, models, metrics) are versioned and stored

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

**Environment setup:**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mlops-opioid
```

**Run end-to-end pipeline:**
```bash
python -m src.main --config config.yaml --stage all
```

**Run inference from any server (after cloning repo and installing dependencies):**
```bash
python -m src.main --stage infer --config config.yaml --input_csv data/inference/new_data.csv --output_csv data/inference/output_predictions.csv
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
pytest
```

## 📈 Next Steps (Planned Enhancements)

- **Experiment Tracking:** Integrate MLflow and/or Weights & Biases for automated tracking of parameters, metrics, and artifacts
- **CI/CD Automation:** Add GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and pipeline automation
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Migrate to Hydra for flexible multi-environment settings
- **Production Monitoring:** Add robust logging, alerting, and drift monitoring tools
